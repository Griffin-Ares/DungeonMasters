# Dungeon Masters' Final Project

For our final project, we've created procedurally generated dungeons with normal mapping for the textures and BÃ©zier curve camera movement. To use our program, run it, click "Upload Scene File", upload resources/lighting.json, and click "Generate Maze". All other instructions for adjusting maze parameters, showing/hiding textures, and navigating the dungeon are shown in the UI.
